# Writeups-Machines
I am a junior pentester and created this repository to upload the machines I work on. This repository contains the step-by-step instructions for all the machines I have completed, and it will be constantly updated. I hope it will be helpful to many people who are starting in this wonderful world of cybersecurity.
